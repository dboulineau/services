# @brief primitive operation interface between the SWAMP's virtual
# machine (VM) infrastructure, and users of the virtual machine infrastructure. The interface
# consist of seven primitive operations. These operations are described as functions along with
# their parameters, and return codes below. Together these operations provide an asynchronous
# interface to users of the SWAMP VM infrastructure to start, stop and manage VM where the user
# selects the OS platform to instantiate, provides an input directory to mount in the VM, and get the
# contents of an output directory mounted in the VM.

# limited to the following:
# amount of memory in the VM
# amount of disk space in noninput/
# output directories
# type of CPU
# number of CPUs
