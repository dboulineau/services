# This script repeatedly creates a filesystem with a random number of files
# containing random data, this filesystem is then attached to a live VM and the
# random files are checked for correctness. This test exercises the ability to
# connect a drive to a live VM as well as communicating to a VM through a
# pseudo-tty instead of using guestfish to scrape files.
# This script assumes that a VM has been created named 'vmtest' and is running 'slave.pl'. 
# This script should be run by/as root since it needs to communicate with VMs
